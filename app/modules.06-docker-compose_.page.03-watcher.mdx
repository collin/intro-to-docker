On this page, we'll set up a simple web server to run as a docker compose service.

We'll start a blank folder for this example.

So first, switch back into your home directory with `cd ~`.

Then, create a new folder with `mkdir composed-web` and switch into it with `cd composed-web`.

You can open this folder in VS Code with `code .`

## Dockerfile

Now, let's create a new file called `Dockerfile.deps` with the following content:

````dockerfile Dockerfile.deps
FROM golang:1.22

# This installs a tool called `gow` that we'll use to build our go module
# whenever the source code changes
RUN go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
```


## Compose file

Now, let's create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml docker-compose.yml
version: "3.6"
services:
  # This is the name of the service in our docker-compose file
  # We can use this name to refer to this service in other parts of the file
  # AS well as from the docker compose CLI
  tools:
    build:
      # This is the Dockerfile we want to use for this service
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.deps
    # This is the working_directory we want to use for this service
    working_dir: /app
    # And these are the volumes we want to mount into the container
    # ${PWD} is a special variable that refers to the current working directory
    # So we're mounting the current working directory into the /app directory in the container
    volumes:
      - ${PWD}:/app
  build:
    # This is the Dockerfile we want to use for this service
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.deps
    # This is the working_directory we want to use for this service
    working_dir: /app
    # And these are the volumes we want to mount into the container
    # ${PWD} is a special variable that refers to the current working directory
    # So we're mounting the current working directory into the /app directory in the container
    volumes:
      - ${PWD}:/app
    # This is the command we want to run when we start this service
    command: gow build server.go -o server
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.deps
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ${PWD}:/app
    command: ./server
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
```

This file sets up a three services called `tools`, `build`, and, `web`. Together, we'll use them to create a full development environment.container.

## Go module

And then, let's use the `tools` to initialize our go module.

<Terminal>docker compose run tools go mod init composed-web</Terminal>

This will create a new `go.mod` file in our current directory.

Now, we'll need to add the `server.go` file.

```go server.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, world!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", helloHandler)
    fmt.Println("Server started on port 80")
    http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
}
```

## Docker up
Now, let's start our services with `docker compose up`.
