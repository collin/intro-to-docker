Now that we've run a few containers, we've created some data in the docker system. We can take a look the containers we have run.

<Terminal>docker container list</Terminal>

You'll see something like this:

<Terminal noCopy>{`
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
`}</Terminal>

<span style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>ü§î</span> But that's not quite right. We just
ran several containers.

We need to add the `--all` flag to see
all the containers, even the ones that have stopped.

<Terminal>docker container list --all</Terminal>

<span style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>üëçüèª</span> Now you should get something like this:

<Terminal noCopy>{`
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS     NAMES

We can look at other resources as well. We'll be covering these resources in greater detail later. This is also not an exhaustive list of the kinds of resources managed by docker. We won't cover all those resources in this class. The purpose of showing you these commands is to give you a peek into how the docker system is organized. You can see that it's a lot like a file system, with directories and files, but instead of directories and files, we have `containers`, `images`, `volumes`, `networks`, etc.
