We can create persistent storage volumes with docker. This is useful for storing data that we want to persist between container runs.

<Terminal>docker volume create my_volume</Terminal>

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    docker: null,
    volume: (
      <Markdown>
        The `volume` subcommand is used to manage volumes in docker. Much like
        containers and images, we have many resource management options, like
        `ls` and `rm`.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    create: (
      <Markdown>
        In this example, we're creating a named persistent volume. This volume
        can be used by any container we run later.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    my_volume: (
      <Markdown>
        This is the name of the volume we're creating. We can use this name to
        reference the volume in other commands.
      </Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

We can see the volume we created with `docker volume ls`. Try it out.

Now, we can run a container with this volume attached.

<Terminal>docker run --rm -it -v my_volume:/data ubuntu bash</Terminal>

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    "docker run --rm -it": null,
    "-v": (
      <Markdown>
        The `-v` or `--volume` flag is used to attach a volume to a container.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "my_volume:/data": (
      <Markdown>
        There are two parts to the value for the volume flag here. The first
        part is the name of the volume we want to attach. The second part is the
        path inside the container where we want to attach the volume. They are
        seperated by `:`. In this case, we're attaching the `my_volume` volume
        to the `/data` directory inside the container.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    ubuntu: (
      <Markdown>
        This is the name of the image we're running. We're running a container
        from the `ubuntu` image.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    bash: (
      <Markdown>
        This is the command we're running inside the container. We're starting a
        bash shell. So this will take over our terminal and we'll be "inside"
        the container.
      </Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

Once you're inside, you can create files in the `/data` directory. These files will be stored in the volume we created earlier. When you exit the container, the files will still be there.

Try using `cd /data` to move into the directory and `touch file.txt` to create a file. Then exit the container with `exit`.

Now, we can use the `docker run` command with the `ls` command to see the files we created in that volume.

<Terminal>docker run --rm -v my_volume:/data ubuntu ls /data</Terminal>

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    "docker run --rm": null,
    "-v": null,
    "my_volume:/data": null,
    ubuntu: null,
    "ls /data": (
      <Markdown>
        This is the command we're running inside the container. We're listing
        the files in the `/data` directory.
      </Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

> Caveat: The volume created this way is managd by `docker` and is stored in the `/var/lib/docker/volumes` directory. In production it's more likely that the storage volumes will be managed by another system, like a cloud provider's storage service, or a container orchestration system such as kubernetes.
