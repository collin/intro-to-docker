Now, we'll create a file called `Dockerfile` in the same projcet directory.

Dockerfiles are used to instruct Docker in how to build an image.

We'll be using the following directives in this Dockerfile:

- `FROM` - This directive specifies the base image to use for the build. In this case, we're using the official Golang image from Docker Hub.

- `WORKDIR` - This directive sets the working directory for the build. We're setting it to `/app`. This is a fairly arbitrary choice, but it's a common convention to use `/app` as the working directory for Docker applications.

- `COPY` - This directive copies files from the host machine into the image. We're copying the `go.mod` file and the `server.go` file into the `/app` directory.

- `RUN` - This directive runs a command in the image. We're using it to build the Go application. Any changes to the filesystem made by the `RUN` command will be committed to the image. So our build artifact, the `server` binary, will be included in the image.

- `CMD` - This directive specifies the command to run when the container is started from the image. In this case, we're running the `server` binary.

All together, that will look like this:

It's worth typing the contents of this file out by hand to begin your familiarizition with the syntax.

```dockerfile Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.22

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./go.mod ./
COPY ./server.go ./

RUN go build -o server server.go

CMD ["./server"]
```

## Building the image

With that Dockerfile in place, we can build the image.

> It's important to be in the correct working directory when running the `docker build` command. The simplest way is to use `cd` to get into the directory that has the Dockerfile in it.

<Terminal>docker build . --tag hello-world-go</Terminal>

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    "docker build": "Instruct docker to build an image from a Dockerfile",
    ".": "The path to the directory containing the Dockerfile and any other resources for the build. The `.` is shorthand for the current directory.",
    "--tag hello-world-go":
      "The `--tag` flag is used to give the image a name. In this case, we're calling it `hello-world-go`.",
  }}
/>
