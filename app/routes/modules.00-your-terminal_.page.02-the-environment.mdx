All terminal windows have a set of environment variables. These are crucial in determining how the shell behaves and how programs run.

You can observe the environment variables by running the `env` command:

```bash
root@18df46ba86d1:/# env
HOSTNAME=18df46ba86d1
PWD=/
HOME=/root
TERM=xterm
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

_In practice, there may be several more environment variables than this, but these are the ones you'll expect to see on any linux machine._

- `HOSTNAME` is the hostname of the computer, and is shown in the promt text
- `PWD` is the current working directory of the terminal, other commands will typcially use this to determine where to read and write files.
- `HOME` is the home directory of the current user. And is used by many programs to determine where to read and write files that are specific to the user.
- `TERM` is the terminal type, and is used by programs to determine how to display text.
- `PATH` is a list of directories, separated by the `:` character. When you run a command, the shell will look in each of these directories in order, and run the first program it finds that matches the program by name.

## Using environment variables

You can use environment variables your your terminaly by prefixing them with a `$` character. For example, to print information about your terminal, you can run:

<Terminal>
  {`echo My home directory is $HOME, and my working directory is $PWD`}
</Terminal>

Give that a try and see what it prints out.

## pwd

The `pwd` command prints the current working directory. It's a simple command, but it's useful to know where you are in the filesystem.

<Terminal>pwd</Terminal>

> Often, when your commands aren't working as you expect them to, it's because you are not in the correct working directory.
