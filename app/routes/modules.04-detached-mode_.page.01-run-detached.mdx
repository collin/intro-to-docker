Previously, we ran our container and mapped port `8080` to it. But the container is attached to our terminal, printing output to it.

We can't use the terminal for anything else while the container is running.

Additionally, if we close our terminal for, the container will be stop.

So, we might want to run our container in "the background". This means the container will run, but not be attached to one particular terminal.

If your container is still running in your terminal, stop it now by pressing `Ctrl+C` with that terminal window focused.

Now, start it again in detached mode:

<Terminal>docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 --detach hello-world-go</Terminal>

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    "docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80": null,
    "--detach": "Run the container in the background",
    "hello-world-go": null,
  }}
/>

Docker will print out a long string of characters. This is the ID of the container that Docker has started. You can use this ID to interact with the container later.

Now, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to confirm everything is still working correctly. You should see the text `Hello, world!` printed on the page.
