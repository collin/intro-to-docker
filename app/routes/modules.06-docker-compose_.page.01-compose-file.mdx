In this section, we'll want to start with a fresh folder to work in.

So first, switch back into your home directory with `cd ~`.

Then, create a new folder with `mkdir compose-intro` and switch into it with `cd compose-intro`.

You can open this folder in VS Code with `code .`

We'll create a docker compose file to hold configuration for a using the go tooling.

Now, let's create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml docker-compose.yml
version: "3.6"
services:
  # This is the name of the service in our docker-compose file
  # We can use this name to refer to this service in other parts of the file
  # AS well as from the docker compose CLI
  tools:
    # This is the image we want to use for this service
    image: golang:1.22
    # This is the working_directory we want to use for this service
    working_dir: /app
    # And these are the volumes we want to mount into the container
    # ${PWD} is a special variable that refers to the current working directory
    # So we're mounting the current working directory into the /app directory in the container
    volumes:
      - ${PWD}:/app
```

This configiruation file is a simple example of a docker-compose file. It defines a single service called `go` that uses the `golang:1.22` image, sets the working directory to `/app` and mounts the current working directory into the `/app` directory in the container.

We can use this with the `docker compose` CLI to run commands in the container.

For example, we can run:

<Terminal>docker compose run tools go version</Terminal>{" "}

to run the `go version` command in the container. We should see something like the following: `go version go1.22.1 linux/arm64`
