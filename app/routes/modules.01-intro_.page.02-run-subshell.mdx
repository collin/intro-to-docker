Now, let's run a quick, instant, ephemeral computed. We'll use the `ubuntu` image. This image is a minimal Ubuntu base image, and it is often used as a starting point for other images.

<Terminal>docker run --interactive --tty ubuntu:latest</Terminal>

If this is your first time running a container from the `ubuntu` image on this machine, you'll see Docker download the image from the Docker Hub. This is a public registry of Docker images, and it's the default place to get images from.

Once everything is downloaded, your terminal will be taken over by a new shell running inside a docker container. You can run commands in this shell, and they'll execute inside the container. Try out `ls`, `whoami`, or `uname -a` to see some details of the machine.

When you're satisfied, you can exit the container by typing `exit` and pressing enter. Your terminal will return to the state it was in before you ran the `docker run` command.

## What's happening here?

Let's break down that docker command

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    "docker run": (
      <Markdown>
        The `docker` command, and it's sub-command `run`. All following parts of
        the command string will be interpreted by the docker program as
        arguments to the `run` sub-command
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "--interactive": (
      <Markdown>
        Instructs Docker run the container in interactive mode. If you don't use
        this flag when opening sub-shells, you may end up with an unresponsive
        terminal.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "--tty": (
      <Markdown>
        Creates a pseudo-TTY for the container. This is usually used with the
        `--interactive` flag. Much like the `--interactive` flag, if you don't
        use this flag, you may end up with an unresponsive terminal.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "ubuntu:latest": (
      <Markdown>
        The name of the image to run. This is the `ubuntu` image, and we're
        using the `latest` tag.
      </Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

That's a little verbose, so here's a short-cut:

<ExplainShell
  fixedFocusIndex={1}
  parts={{
    "docker run": null,
    "-it": (
      <>
        Typically, you'll use the short-hand flags to specify `--interactive`
        and `--tty` together.
      </>
    ),
    "ubuntu:latest": null,
  }}
/>
