It's great to be able to cleanup your workspace as you go. But it's even better to keep things tidy as you go. Docker has a built-in feature to remove containers as soon as they stop running.

<Terminal>docker run --rm ubuntu:latest echo "This will be removed"</Terminal>

<ExplainShell
  fixedFocusIndex={1}
  parts={{
    "docker run": null,
    "--rm": (
      <Markdown>
        Remove the container when it exits. Note that this flag comes after
        `docker run` and before the image name.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "ubuntu:latest": null,
    echo: null,
    ['"This will be removed"']: null,
  }}
/>

This can be combined with the `-it` flags when running an interactive shell. This way, you can run a command and then have the container removed when you exit.

<Terminal>docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest</Terminal>
