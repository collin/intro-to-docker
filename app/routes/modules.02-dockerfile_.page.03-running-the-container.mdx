After the last page, we should have a docker image with the tag `hello-world-go`.

That means we can run it with docker.

<Terminal>docker run --rm -it hello-world-go</Terminal>

If you run that, you should see the output of our Go server: `Server starting on port 80`

Check out what's going on at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) in your browser.

> 🚨 You should see there's nothing there.

That's because we haven't set up networking for docker yet. We'll do that in the next module after we have a group discussion and demonstration about how to expose ports.
