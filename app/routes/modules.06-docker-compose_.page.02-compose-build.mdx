In the last page, we used the `image:` key to specify the image we wanted to use for our service. This is a simple way to use an image, but it's not the only way.

Sometimes, we may need to build a custom image for our service. We can do this by using the `build:` key instead of the `image:` key.

Let's see how this works.

We'll start a blank folder for this example.

So first, switch back into your home directory with `cd ~`.

Then, create a new folder with `mkdir compose-builder` and switch into it with `cd compose-builder`.

You can open this folder in VS Code with `code .`

We'll start by creating a Dockerfile for our custom image.

In this scenario, we'll work as though we're building a video processing application that depends on `ffmpeg`. That doesn't come pre-installed in the `golang` image, so we'll need to create a custom image that includes it.

Create a new file called `Dockerfile.deps` with the following content:

```dockerfile Dockerfile.deps
FROM golang:1.22

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg
```

Notice that we're not adding any files, or doing anything else in this Dockerfile. We're just using the `golang:1.22` image as a base, and then installing `ffmpeg` with `apt-get`. That's why were calling it `Dockerfile.deps` - it's just for the dependencies.

If we had any other dependencies, including other go packages, we could add additional `COPY` and run `RUN` commands to reference and install them.

Now, let's create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml docker-compose.yml
version: "3.6"
services:
  # This is the name of the service in our docker-compose file
  # We can use this name to refer to this service in other parts of the file
  # AS well as from the docker compose CLI
  tools:
    # This is the image we want to use for this service
    build:
      # This is the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile we want to use
      context: .
      # This is the name of the Dockerfile we want to use
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.deps
    # This is the working_directory we want to use for this service
    working_dir: /app
    # And these are the volumes we want to mount into the container
    # ${PWD} is a special variable that refers to the current working directory
    # So we're mounting the current working directory into the /app directory in the container
    volumes:
      - ${PWD}:/app
```

The key difference in this file is that we're using the `build:` key instead of the `image:` key. This tells docker compose to build a custom image using the Dockerfile we've specified.

Now go ahead and run the following command:

<Terminal>docker compose run tools go version</Terminal>

Before the command runs, docker will build the container as specified in the `Dockerfile.deps` file. This will include the `ffmpeg` package we installed.

So you can also run `docker compose run tools ffmpeg -version` to see that `ffmpeg` is installed.
