Creating, moving, copying and deleting files are common tasks when working with the command line.

## Creating Files

To create a new file, use the `touch` command followed by the name of the file you want to create.

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    touch: (
      <Markdown>
        `touch` is a built-in command that creates a new file with the name you
        specify. If the file already exists, `touch` will update the file's
        modification time to the current time.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "file.txt": (
      <Markdown>
        This is the name of the file you want to create. You can replace
        `file.txt` with any name you want. You can also specify a path in
        another directory here. Such as `my-files/file.txt`. That will be
        combined with the current working directory to determine the full path.
      </Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

### Quick Practice

<ShellPractice
  commands={{
    "Create a new file called `hello.txt`": "touch hello.txt",
    "Create a new file called `my-files/hello.txt`": "touch my-files/hello.txt",
    "Create a new file called `server.go`": "touch server.go",
  }}
/>

## Moving Files

To move a file from one location to another, use the `mv` command followed by the name of the file you want to move and the new location. It can also be thought of as renaming a file.

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    mv: (
      <>
        <Markdown>
          `mv` is a built-in command that moves a file from one location to
          another.
          ðŸš¨ If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten.
        </Markdown>
      </>
    ),
    "file.txt": <Markdown>The path of the file you wish to move.</Markdown>,
    "renamed-file.txt": (
      <Markdown>The new path you'd like to move the file to.</Markdown>
    ),

}}
/>

### Quick Practice

<ShellPractice
  commands={{
    "Move `file.txt` to `renamed-file.txt`": "mv file.txt renamed-file.txt",
    "Move `file.txt` to `my-files/file.txt`": "mv file.txt my-files/file.txt",
  }}
/>

## Copying Files

To copy a file from one location to another, use the `cp` command followed by the name of the file you want to copy and the new location. This is similar to the `mv` command, but it leaves the original file in place.

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    cp: (
      <Markdown>
        `cp` is a built-in command that copies a file from one location to
        another.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "file.txt": <Markdown>The path of the file you wish to copy.</Markdown>,
    "copied-file.txt": (
      <Markdown>The new path you'd like to copy the file to.</Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

### Quick Practice

<ShellPractice
  commands={{
    "Copy `file.txt` to `copied-file.txt`": "cp file.txt copied-file.txt",
    "Copy `file.txt` to `my-files/file.txt`": "cp file.txt my-files/file.txt",
  }}
/>

## Deleting Files

To delete a file, use the `rm` command followed by the name of the file you want to delete.

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    rm: (
      <>
        <Markdown>
          `rm` is a built-in command that deletes a file. ðŸš¨ Be careful, this
          action is irreversible. Deleting with `rm` skips the Trash/Recycli
          bin.
        </Markdown>
      </>
    ),
    "file.txt": <Markdown>The path of the file you wish to delete.</Markdown>,
  }}
/>

### Quick Practice

<ShellPractice
  commands={{
    "Delete `file.txt`": "rm file.txt",
    "Delete `my-files/file.txt`": "rm my-files/file.txt",
  }}
/>

## Making Directories

To create a new directory, use the `mkdir` command followed by the name of the directory you want to create.

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    mkdir: (
      <Markdown>
        `mkdir` is a built-in command that creates a new directory with the name
        you specify.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "my-directory": (
      <Markdown>
        This is the name of the directory you want to create. You can replace
        `my-directory` with any name you want. You can also specify a path in
        another directory here. Such as `my-files/my-directory`. That will be
        combined with the current working directory to determine the full path.
      </Markdown>
    ),
  }}

/>

### Quick Practice

<ShellPractice
  commands={{
    "Create a new directory called `my-directory`": "mkdir my-directory",
    "Create a new directory called `my-files/my-directory`":
      "mkdir my-files/my-directory",
  }}
/>

## Moving Directories

To move a directory from one location to another, use the `mv` command followed by the name of the directory you want to move and the new location. It can also be thought of as renaming a directory.

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    mv: (
      <>
        <Markdown>
          `mv` is a built-in command that moves a directory from one location to
          another. ðŸš¨ If the destination directory already exists, it will be
          overwritten.
        </Markdown>
      </>
    ),
    "my-directory": (
      <Markdown>The path of the directory you wish to move.</Markdown>
    ),
    "renamed-directory": (
      <Markdown>The new path you'd like to move the directory to.</Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

### Quick Practice

<ShellPractice
  commands={{
    "Move `my-directory` to `renamed-directory`":
      "mv my-directory renamed-directory",
    "Move `my-directory` to `my-files/my-directory`":
      "mv my-directory my-files/my-directory",
  }}
/>

## Copying Directories

To copy a directory from one location to another, use the `cp` command followed by the name of the directory you want to copy and the new location. This is similar to the `mv` command, but it leaves the original directory in place.

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    cp: (
      <Markdown>
        `cp` is a built-in command that copies a directory from one location to
        another.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "my-directory": (
      <Markdown>The path of the directory you wish to copy.</Markdown>
    ),
    "copied-directory": (
      <Markdown>The new path you'd like to copy the directory to.</Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

### Quick Practice

<ShellPractice
  commands={{
    "Copy `my-directory` to `copied-directory`":
      "cp my-directory copied-directory",
    "Copy `my-directory` to `my-files/my-directory`":
      "cp my-directory my-files/my-directory",
  }}
/>

## Deleting Directories

To delete a directory, use the `rmdir` command followed by the name of the directory you want to delete.

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    rmdir: (
      <>
        <Markdown>
          `rmdir` is a built-in command that deletes a directory. ðŸš¨ Be careful,
          this action is irreversible. Deleting with `rmdir` skips the
          Trash/Recycling bin.
        </Markdown>
      </>
    ),
    "my-directory": (
      <Markdown>The path of the directory you wish to delete.</Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

> ðŸš¨ When using `rmdir`. It will only delete empty directories. If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents, use `rm -rf`. But be careful, there is no undo.

### Quick Practice

<ShellPractice
  commands={{
    "Delete `my-directory`": "rmdir my-directory",
    "Delete `my-files/my-directory`": "rmdir my-files/my-directory",
    "Delete `my-directory` and all of its contents. (use the dangerous command)":
      "rm -rf my-directory",
  }}
/>
