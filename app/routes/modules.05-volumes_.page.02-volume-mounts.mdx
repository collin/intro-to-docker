We can mount volumes from the host machine into a container. This is useful for persisting data between container runs, or for using a docker container to operate on files on the host machine.

In this case, we don't need to create a named volume, becasue we're using a directory on the host machine.

Let's start by switching to our home directory with `cd ~`.

Then create a directory to use as a mount with `mkdir my_mount`.

And add a file to the directory with the following snippet:

<Terminal>echo "Hello, world" > my_mount/hello.txt</Terminal>

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    [`echo "Hello, world"`]: (
      <Markdown>
        This emits the text `Hello, world` to the standard output.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    [`>`]: (
      <Markdown>
        This is a redirection operator. It takes the standard output of the
        command on the left and writes it to the file on the right.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    [`my_mount/hello.txt`]: (
      <Markdown>This is the path to the file we want to write to.</Markdown>
    ),
  }}
/>

Now we can run a container with this directory mounted.

<Terminal>docker run --rm -it -v ~/my_mount:/data ubuntu bash</Terminal>

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    "docker run --rm -it": null,
    "-v": (
      <Markdown>
        The `-v` or `--volume` flag is used to attach a volume to a container.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    "~/my_mount:/data": (
      <Markdown>
        There are two parts to the value for the volume flag here. The first
        part is the path on the host machine we want to attach. The second part
        is the path inside the container where we want to attach the volume.
        They are seperated by `:`. In this case, we're attaching the
        `~/my_mount` directory to the `/data` directory inside the container.
      </Markdown>
    ),
    ubuntu: null,
    bash: null,
  }}
/>

Inside that subshell, we can see the file we created on the host machine. Let's check it out with `cat /data/hello.txt`. You should see `Hello, world` printed to the terminal.

We can also create a file inside the container and see it on the host machine. Let's create a file with:

<Terminal>echo "Goodbye, world" > /data/goodbye.txt</Terminal>

Then we can exit the container with `exit`.

Now, back on the host machine, we can see both files are in the `my_mount` directory.

<Terminal>ls ~/my_mount</Terminal>
