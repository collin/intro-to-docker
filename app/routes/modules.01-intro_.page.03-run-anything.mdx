We can use docker run any program inside of a container, provided it's been pre-installed in the container image. For example, we can run the `date` command in ubuntu to print the current date and time:

<Terminal>docker run ubuntu:latest date</Terminal>

<ExplainShell

parts={{
    "docker run ubuntu:latest":
      "Which image to run. Note that we're not using `-it` here. That's because the `date` command isn't interactive, so we don't need to attach attach our terminal.",
    date: "The command to run inside the container",
  }}
/>

If you run that, you should see the current date and time printed back out for you.

Or, for a bit of whimsy, we can run the `cowsay` program in the `docker/whalesay` image to have a whale say hello to us:

<Terminal
  children={`docker run docker/whalesay cowsay "hello, it's lovely to be here in the sea"`}
/>

Should everything go well, you should see a whale saying hello to you:

<Terminal noCopy>
  {`
 ______________________________________
/ hello, it's lovely to be here in the \\
\\ sea                                  /
 --------------------------------------
    \\
     \\
      \\
                    ##        .
              ## ## ##       ==
           ## ## ## ##      ===
       /""""""""""""""""___/ ===
  ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
       \\______ o          __/
        \\    \\        __/
          \\____\\______/
`}
</Terminal>

There were some differences between that command and the one we ran before. Let's break it down:

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    "docker run": null,
    "docker/whalesay":
      "This specifies an image to run. The `/` indicates the container belongs to an organization on Dockerhub. Some images, like `ubuntu` are official images, and don't need to have their organization specified.",
    cowsay:
      "The command to run inside the container. The reason why this is called `cowsay` is esoteric, but it's a fun little program that takes a string as an argument, and prints out a little ASCII art of a cow saying that string. This example is a variation that uses a whale instead of a cow.",
    [`"hello, it's lovely to be here in the sea"`]:
      "The argument to the `cowsay` command",
  }}
/>

Another way to look at that command, is to split it into two parts:

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    "docker run docker/whalesay":
      "This is our instruction to docker, it specifes which image to run, and any other configuration options. (In this example, there are none.)",
    [`cowsay "hello, it's lovely to be here in the sea"`]:
      "The second part of the command is the command to run inside the container. In this case, we're running the `cowsay` command, and passing it the string `hello, it's lovely to be here in the sea` as an argument.",
  }}
/>
