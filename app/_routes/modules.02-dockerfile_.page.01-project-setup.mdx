The first thing we'll need to do is create a directory for our project.

First, make sure you're in your home directory by running `cd ~`.

Then:

- use `mkdir` to create a new directory called `hello-world-go`.
- use `cd` to move into the new directory.

<Terminal>{`
mkdir hello-world-go
cd hello-world-go
`}</Terminal>

Now that we're in the `hello-world go` directory, we can use the `code` command to open it in Visual Studio Code.

<Terminal>{`
code .
`}</Terminal>

<ExplainShell
  parts={{
    code: "A special program installed by Visual Studio code to open directories in the editor.",
    ".": "The current directory, which will be opened in Visual Studio Code.",
  }}
/>

Once Visual Studio Code is open, We can create some new files. One way to creat a new file is to right click on the file browser and select "New File".

  <img src="/new-file.png" style={{ maxWidth: 500, poddingTop: "2rem" }} />
</figure>

The first file to create is a minimal Go server. We'll call it `server.go`.

You can copy this code into the new file:

```go server.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, world!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", helloHandler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
}
```

You'll also need a file called `go.mod` to tell Go that this is a module. Create a new file called `go.mod` and copy this code into it:

```go go.mod
module simple-server

go 1.22.0
```
